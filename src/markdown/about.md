I'm a software developer based in Phoenix, Arizona.

My focus has mainly been in building micro-UI React applications, but I'm also skilled in back-end development with Node.js, GraphQL, and Java.

When I'm not generating surplus value, I'm providing software solutions for grassroot movements and non-profits ✊ — or bike-packing.
